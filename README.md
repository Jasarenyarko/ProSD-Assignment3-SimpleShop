# ProSD-Assignment3-SimpleShop
Welcome to the SimpleShop repository! This project implements an invoice generating program designed for a shop. The program reads orders from an input TAG file, processes them, calculates VAT, discounts, and the total price based on the type of customer, and finally prints an invoice to the console.

Repository Structure

This repository contains two primary sub-projects:

SimpleShop: This is the main project containing the invoice generation logic.
SimpleShop.Test: This project contains NUnit tests to ensure the functionality of the SimpleShop project.
